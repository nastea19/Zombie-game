# Zombie Combat
*Zombie Combat* is a 2D Java game where you must defend your base against batches of zombies. Survive as long as you can by shooting zombies - once either your health points or the health base of the base reaches 0, the game is over. The number of zombies you managed to elminate is displayed after the game is over.

# Controls
By pressing or holding:
 - **W** - player moves up
 - **A** - player moves left
 - **S** - player moves down
 - **D** - player moves right
 - **Spacebar** - player shoots bullets

 # Game Mechanics
 - A batch of 3 zombies spawn every 10 seconds at random positions on the border of the screen.
 - The player, zombies, and base all have HP (Health Points).
 - If **player HP <= 0** or **base HP <= 0**, the game ends.
 - The *Game Over* screen shows the total number of zombies killed.

 # Research Topics
 - **GitHub** - We learned how to use GitHub for working on the same project simultaneously without conflicts, by tracking changes and commits.
 - **Double Buffering** - Double Buffering makes animations and movement of elements look smoother, by making the changes on backstage and displaying them to user afterwards.
